## Challenges Faced/ Future Features:
### Working on different branches as a group on Github was one of the challenges we faced (Git merge, push, pull from/to main branch).
### Streachable feature we can practice in the future is to embed Spotify player on the page, so that users instantly find and listen to their music on the website.
